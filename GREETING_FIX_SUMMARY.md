# AI Chatbot - Greeting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The AI chatbot was providing unwanted financial information when users simply said "hello" or other greetings:

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "hello"
Bot: "Hello! Here's the essential information you requested:
Category: Groceries NPR amount: 3,300.00"
```

This was happening because:
1. The AI service (Ollama) was being called for ALL messages, including greetings
2. The AI service was too aggressive in providing financial data
3. No filtering was done to distinguish between greetings and financial questions

## Root Cause
The issue was in the ChatView logic where the AI service was called first, before checking if the message was a greeting or non-financial question.

**Problematic Flow:**
1. User sends "hello"
2. AI service immediately processes the message
3. AI service provides financial data regardless of the message type
4. User gets unwanted financial information

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Pre-Filtering Logic**
Added greeting detection BEFORE calling the AI service:

```python
# Check for greetings and non-financial messages first
user_message_lower = user_message.lower()

# Handle greetings and non-financial messages
if any(word in user_message_lower for word in ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'greetings']):
    response = "Hello! I'm your AI financial assistant. Ask me about your finances!"
elif any(word in user_message_lower for word in ['how are you', 'how do you do', 'what\'s up']):
    response = "I'm doing well, thank you! I'm here to help with your finances. What would you like to know?"
elif any(word in user_message_lower for word in ['thanks', 'thank you', 'bye', 'goodbye']):
    response = "You're welcome! Feel free to ask me about your finances anytime."
else:
    # Only call AI service for actual financial questions
    # ... AI service logic here
```

### 2. **Updated AI Service Prompt**
Enhanced the AI service instructions to be more conservative:

```python
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Answer with ONLY the essential information
2. Use format: "Category: NPR amount" or "Amount: NPR value"
3. No explanations, no percentages, no extra words
4. Keep responses under 20 words
5. Use exact numbers from data
6. No emojis or formatting
7. ONLY provide financial data if user asks a specific financial question
8. For greetings or general chat, just say hello back
```

### 3. **Improved Fallback Responses**
Updated fallback responses to handle greetings properly:

```python
elif any(word in user_message_lower for word in ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'greetings']):
    return "Hello! I'm your AI financial assistant. Ask me about your finances!"

else:
    return "I'm here to help with your finances. Ask me about your spending, budget, savings, or any financial questions!"
```

- **Social**: how are you, what's up, thanks, goodbye
- **Financial**: budget, spending, expenses, savings, income, etc.
