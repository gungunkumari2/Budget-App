## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced ExpenseExtractor Class
```python
class ExpenseExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Multiple OCR engines
        self.easyocr_reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
        
    def extract_from_file(self, file_path):
        # Enhanced extraction with error recovery
        return self._extract_from_image_with_recovery(file_path)
        
    def _extract_from_image_with_recovery(self, image_path):
        # Multiple OCR attempts with confidence scoring
        # 1. Standard Tesseract
        # 2. Enhanced preprocessing + Tesseract
        # 3. EasyOCR fallback
```

### Quality Control System
```python
def _validate_extraction(self, data):
    validation_results = {
        'is_valid': True,
        'warnings': [],
        'errors': [],
        'suggestions': [],
        'quality_score': 0.0,
        'needs_review': False
    }
    # Comprehensive validation logic
```

### Manual Review Interface
```typescript
interface ManualReviewModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  extractionResult: ExtractionResult | null;
  onConfirm: (correctedData: ExtractionResult) => void;
  onReject: () => void;
}
```
