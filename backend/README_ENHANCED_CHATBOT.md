## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Financial Summary
**User**: "Show me my financial summary"
**AI**: 
```
📊 **Financial Summary**

💰 **Income**: NPR 50,000.00
💸 **Expenses**: NPR 35,000.00
💎 **Savings**: NPR 15,000.00 (30.0% of income)

📈 **Top Categories**: Food & Dining (NPR 8,500.00), Transportation (NPR 6,200.00), Shopping (NPR 4,800.00)
🏪 **Top Vendors**: Grocery Store (NPR 3,200.00), Gas Station (NPR 2,100.00), Restaurant (NPR 1,800.00)

📈 **Trend**: Your spending has increased by 5.2% compared to previous months

💡 **Financial Health**: Your savings rate of 30.0% indicates good financial health.
```

### Example 2: Personalized Advice
**User**: "How can I save more money?"
**AI**:
```
To **improve your savings** (currently 30.0%), I suggest:

✅ aim to save at least 20% of your income
✅ consider reducing spending in Food & Dining which is 17.0% of your income

💸 **Highest Spending**: Food & Dining at NPR 8,500.00

💡 **Quick Wins**:
• Review subscriptions and cancel unused ones
• Cook more meals at home
• Use public transport when possible
• Set up automatic savings transfers
```

### Example 3: Educational Response
**User**: "What is compound interest?"
**AI**:
```
Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your original money (principal) and the interest you've already earned. It's like a snowball effect for your money!

**How it works:**
• Year 1: NPR 10,000 × 5% = NPR 500 interest
• Year 2: NPR 10,500 × 5% = NPR 525 interest
• Year 3: NPR 11,025 × 5% = NPR 551.25 interest

**The Power of Compound Interest:**
• NPR 10,000 at 5% for 10 years = NPR 16,289
• NPR 10,000 at 5% for 20 years = NPR 26,533
• NPR 10,000 at 5% for 30 years = NPR 43,219

💡 **For Your Situation**: With your current savings rate of 30.0%, you're in a great position to take advantage of compound interest. Consider investing your excess savings for long-term growth!
